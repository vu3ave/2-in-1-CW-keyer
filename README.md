# 2-in-1-CW-keyer

For decades cw (telegraphy message on the radio) have become popular
Mode of communication. It is more reliable as it can be done
Even at worse climatic conditions. cw mode is done in
Digital method, which is easy and accurate to transmit without errors for a prolonged time.


Sending CW (radio telegraphy)

///////////////////////////////

Samuel Morse invented telegraphy in 1844, ever since
This method is used for communication. This method is
so basic that it is easy to use in ananlog and digital way.

Morse code, is used in Land communcation using wires
and in radio telegraphy ( send as sound tones or carrier wave )

In Morse code, there are TWO states, 
DIT - Short press of Telegraphy key ( which is basically an electric switch)
DAH - Long press of Telegraphy key

The combination of DIT and DAH with proper time spacing can generate
Letters and words and sentance of messages


for exampe :
 DIT -  space - DAH : means letter 'a'
 DIT -  space - DAH - space - DAH : means letter 'w'


Morse code table contains all combinations
used. 

There are all english alphebets, conunting digits and some special characters




	

Sending cw in digital method has following benifits:

///////////////////////////////////////////////////

1. Sender can write the message to send , even before stating communication
2. Sender can Write preset 8 messages , and change them at any time
3. Pause / Continue sending cw at any moment, during cw communication 
4. Send messages with out any errors, as the message is displayed , before sending
5. Can edit/rewrite messages during sending,, only displayed messages are send
6. Can change the speed of sending ( WPM ), during the cw communication in progress
7. Can change the audio frequency of cw side tone , that come out of speaker
8. Can change between Mode1 and Mode2 ( Paddle keyer and CW Keyboard )
9. Start the keyer in Mode1 (Paddle keyer Mode)
10. Can Store the side tone Frequency and WPM of last session
